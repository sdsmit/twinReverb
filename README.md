# twinReverb

An attempt to simulate a mid 1960s Fender Twin Reverb (minus the reverb). 

The code is based on measurements made on my twin amp and information found at: https://www.guitarscience.net/tsc/fender.htm#RIN=38k&R1=100k&RT=250k&RB=250k&RM=10k&RL=1M&C1=250p&C2=100n&C3=47n&RB_pot=LogA&RM_pot=Linear&RT_pot=LogA
